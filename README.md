# Hello-Wordl-Game
A word-guessing game

## Description

`What was your motivation?`  To demonstrate to potential employers our ability to create a full stack, fully functional and interactive web application as a team.  

`Why did you build this project?`  As a group, we agreed on building an application that would stimulate the mind in a fun and challenging new way, by modifying a game-concept that was already familiar, and making it our own.

`What problem does it solve?`  In a world that moves so fast, people need a mental escape.  And with Hello-Wordl, you'll get just that.  


`What did you learn?`  A better and more thorough understanding of how each file is interlinkined, and how the smallest mistakes can make or break the application

Once the user data is entered, you'll be directed back to the homepage and you can now play the game. You have 6 chances to guess the 6-letter 'target-word' to win the game.  If you type a word that is not in the games dictionary, the gameboard "shakes" and "Not In Word List" appears.

If you type a word that has none of the target-word's letters, the word stays on the board, if it does contain letters that are in the target word, they light-up green OR yellow. Green means the letters being typed are in the correct order of the target-word, and yellow means the letters are in the target-word, but not in the correct order.

If you guess the target-word, the game ends, and "You Win" appears above the gameboard.  If you don't guess the target-word, the game ends and the target-word appears above the gameboard.
